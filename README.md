# C - Binary Trees

Author: Fati_Zid

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions and implementations related to binary trees in the C programming language. The code is organized into different directories, each focusing on a specific aspect of binary trees.

## Directories

- **0-binary_tree_node**: Implementation of a function to create a new node for a binary tree.
- **1-binary_tree_insert_left**: Implementation of a function to insert a node as the left-child of another node in a binary tree.

- **2-binary_tree_insert_right**: Implementation of a function to insert a node as the right-child of another node in a binary tree.

- **3-binary_tree_delete**: Implementation of a function to delete an entire binary tree.

- **4-binary_tree_is_leaf**: Implementation of a function to check if a given node in a binary tree is a leaf.

- **5-binary_tree_is_root**: Implementation of a function to check if a given node in a binary tree is the root.

## Compilation and Testing

To compile the code, you can use a standard C compiler. For example:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o binary_tree
```
